We are a mix of users, developers, and trainers providing feedback and energy to improve and expand the Galaxy single cell and spatial omics capabilities.
 - **Developers**: Are you developing single cell tools in Galaxy, or looking for a place to develop in Galaxy? Do you need users, testers, or just want to make sure you're not wrapping the same tools as someone else!
 - **Users**: Do you use Galaxy single cell tools for scRNA-seq or beyond? Do you have feedback for us? Want to be a tester of new resources? Do you want to request new resources?
 - **Trainers**: Do you use Galaxy to train others in single cell analysis? Do you have feedback or requests on how we can support users better now and in the future?
 - **Bioinformaticians**: Do you do single cell analysis (in Galaxy or outside of it?) Want to contribute to making sure our resources are the best, up-to-date practices in the field? Do you have feedback on how we can do better?

Do you want to impact the future of single cell in Galaxy?

**Welcome to üññüèæSPOC: the Galaxy Single-cell & sPatial Omics Community of practice!**

## I'm just trying to learn to analyse my data, how did I get here?

# What are the goals of üññüèæSPOC?

<i class="fa fa-bullseye" aria-hidden="true"></i> Goals
- Prevent work duplication
- Collaborate across pipeline, ensuring users feedback to developers
- Identify community needs
- Tool & tutorial development
- Testing
- Build & support user community
- Benchmarking tools and workflows

# Who are we looking for?

Anyone with energy! We love hearing from users, developers, trainers, and everyone in between who is using or developing Galaxy for single cell analysis.

# How do we function?

**Meetings** We meet every 4 weeks (alternating USA, EU and AU time zones) for 1 hour.

Our meeting agenda is:
1. Random intro chatter & introductions
2. Updates from ClickUp site (what people are working on / asking for help)
    - <i class="fa fa-optin-monster" aria-hidden="true"></i> Help/bugs
    - Status reports & new stuff that‚Äôs happening
3. Other cool stuff (example: Smorgasbord)
4. Ongoing actions to send out

**Emails** We send out emails to the mailing list after each meeting, at the mid-way point between meetings, and the day before meetings as a reminder.

**Notes** We keep rolling notes on a googledoc and monitor our work on ClickUp.

**Collaborative Chat Forums** When people ask for help or are working across institutes, we set up chat sub-channels to bring them together.

**General Chat Forum** We have a chat forum to discuss news and ideas, and are represented in the Galaxy Community Reps chat group.
