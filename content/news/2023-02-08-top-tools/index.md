Did you ever wonder which was the number one most used tool in the GTN? There is a new page of Top Tools where we list all of the top tools in the GTN, and which tutorials use them. We guessed “upload1”, but it seems like not every author annotates that step explicitly in their tutorial, and of course it doesn’t appear in the workflows which we also scan to create this tool listing.
