We are pleased to announce the first group of scholarship awardees for the [James Taylor Foundation's Junior Training and Educational Hotspot (JTech)](https://jxtxfoundation.org/donate) program.  JTech supports graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty working at the intersection of computational biology and data science.  The first group of 10 awardees are graduate students presenting their work at the [2020 CSHL Biological Data Science](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=data&year=20) conference.  Awardees represent ten institutions and are presenting a wide range of research at the meeting:

In addition to covering conference registration, awardees will also be paired with senior researchers in the field prior to the conference.  Awardees and mentors will meet before and during the conference to establish what we hope will become long term relationships.

## About JTech

“The most important job of senior faculty is to mentor junior faculty and students.” These are the words that Professor [James P. Taylor](/jxtx/), the Ralph S. O’Connor Professor at the Departments of Biology and Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University said and lived by. This, he believed, was imperative to advance science, and in a way that facilitated diversity and inclusion. The mission of this foundation is to continue his legacy, through a multifaceted approach which will be unrolled across several stages.
