## Keynotes

The conference featured notable keynote speakers, including Jana Klánová from Masaryk University, who discussed the integration of exposomics into biomedical sciences. She highlighted the importance of studying environmental exposures and their effects on health, introduced RECETOX, and discussed European initiatives like PARC and EIRENE that support exposome research. Ute Gunsenheimer, Secretary General of the EOSC Association, spoke on building the EOSC Federation and the potential role of Galaxy. Dr. Daria Onichtchouk from the University of Freiburg shared her extensive use of the Galaxy platform in her research on the genetic control of pluripotency, focusing on the maternal to zygotic transition in zebrafish and its underlying mechanisms, including chromatin accessibility and nucleosome affinity.

## Freiburg Galaxy Team Talks in GCC 2024 Talks Sessions

Members of the Freiburg Galaxy team delivered a series of talks at the GCC conference, focusing on various aspects of data analysis and the utilization of Galaxy. Topics included integrating tools, strategies for effectively navigating complex data landscapes, innovative workflow management and optimization approaches, and a pioneering GitHub workflow aimed at automating social media outreach to enhance community engagement.

## CoFest

## Social Events

### Conference Dinner and Mendel Museum

The conference dinner at the [Augustinian Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas%27s_Abbey,_Brno) at Mendel's square was really special. We had the opportunity to dine where Gregor Mendel conducted his famous experiments. Along with a delicious meal, we enjoyed free access to the Mendel Museum. The guided tours of the abbey, including Mendel's room and the library, were fascinating and provided us with insights into the history of genetics and Mendel's groundbreaking work.

### City Tours and Villa Tugendhat

On Wednesday, we had a delightful day exploring the [Villa Tugendhat](https://www.tugendhat.eu/en/) and [the city of Brno](https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/explore-brno/). A total of 31 people, divided into two groups, visited the Villa Tugendhat, while 66 people in two groups toured the city.

One Villa tour group took the tram, and another group enjoyed a walk despite the warm weather. The Villa Tugendhat visit was particularly special due to its remarkable modernity for its time. Designed by German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the villa was built in just two years by the wealthy and influential Jewish Czech Tugendhat family. It is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

During the city tour, we explored the main sights of Brno's city center with guided tours organized by the Brno Tourist Information Centre. We visited the Old Town Hall, St. Peter's Cathedral, as well as the Freedom and Market Squares. The experience was enjoyable and provided a rich insight into Brno's history and culture.

### Conference Nights Activities

Beyond the enriching presentations and discussions, conference nights were filled with fun and camaraderie. Groups of attendees ventured out to the Bouldering Rock Climbing Hall, testing their climbing skills and bonding over shared challenges. Others enjoyed friendly competitions at local billiards halls.

Dinner outings were a highlight, with groups exploring Brno’s culinary scene, sampling delicious Mexican and Indian cuisine. The evenings often concluded with open-air talks, where participants relaxed and enjoyed local beers and [Kofola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofola) at various pubs and bars, further strengthening connections and creating memorable experiences.
