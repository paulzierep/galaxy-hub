## Panel Discussion

GCC2024 hosted a panel discussion with prominent members of the Galaxy community, moderated by Enis Afgan, Associate Research Scientist at Johns Hopkins University and Galaxy Project Administrator. The panelists were Brad Langhorst, Group Leader at New England Biolabs; Shurjo K. Sen, Program Director at the National Institutes of Health; Wendi Bacon, Senior Lecturer at The Open University and Galaxy Project Administrator with expertise in single-cell analysis; and Jeremy Goecks, Assistant Center Director of Research Informatics at Moffitt Cancer Center. They provided valuable insights from diverse sectors of the Galaxy ecosystem, including biotechnology, medical research, and federal funding.

## Birds of a Feather (BoF)

Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions at GCC2024 offered a vibrant platform for diverse Galaxy ecosystem communities to exchange ideas on a wide range of topics.
The 13 sessions covered subjects from technical data management to microbiology and mass spectrometry, and included discussions on upcoming events like the Galaxy Training Academy in October and the Art of Phylogeny.
The Freiburg team actively contributed by leading sessions on:

- **The Future of Galaxy in EOSC** by Björn Grüning
- **Galaxy Collaborative Writing Group** by Marisa Loach
- **microGalaxy SIG with BioDIGS and GDSCN** by Paul Zierep

## CoFest

The Collaboration Fest (CoFest) concluded the conference, bringing together new and experienced Galaxy contributors for two days of discussion, learning, and cooperation at [Open Gardens](https://www.otevrenazahrada.cz/).
Participants enjoyed the serene garden environment, taking breaks to visit the deers, pigs, chickens and rabbits. New contributors received guidance on the Galaxy Training Network from Saskia and Helena,
while students like Shweta began learning tool wrapping under Björn's mentorship. Experienced contributors collaborated on new projects, including setting out a Galaxy Roadmap,
creating a unified template for subdomains, and developing tools to improve data citations and workflow integration. CoFest fostered community growth and inspired future contributions.

## Social Events

### Conference Dinner and Mendel Museum

The conference dinner at the [Augustinian Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas%27s_Abbey,_Brno/) at Mendel's Square was really special. We had the opportunity to dine where
Gregor Mendel conducted his famous experiments. Along with a delicious meal, we enjoyed free access to the Mendel Museum. The guided tours of the abbey, including Mendel's room and the
library, were fascinating and provided us with insights into the history of genetics and Mendel's groundbreaking work.

### City Tours and Villa Tugendhat

On Wednesday, we had a delightful day exploring the [Villa Tugendhat](https://www.tugendhat.eu/en/) and [the city of Brno](https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/explore-brno/).
A total of 31 people, divided into two groups, visited the Villa Tugendhat, while 66 people in two groups toured the city.

One Villa tour group took the tram, and another group enjoyed a walk despite the warm weather. The Villa Tugendhat visit was particularly special due to its remarkable modernity for its time.
Designed by German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the villa was built in just two years by the wealthy and influential Jewish Czech Tugendhat family. It is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

During the city tour, we explored the main sights of Brno's city center with guided tours organized by the Brno Tourist Information Centre. We visited the Old Town Hall, St. Peter's Cathedral,
as well as the Freedom and Market Squares. The experience was enjoyable and provided a rich insight into Brno's history and culture.

### Conference Nights Activities

Beyond the enriching presentations and discussions, conference nights were filled with fun and camaraderie. Groups of attendees ventured out to the Bouldering Rock Climbing Hall, testing their climbing skills and bonding over shared challenges. Others enjoyed friendly competitions at local billiards halls.

Dinner outings were a highlight, with groups exploring Brno’s culinary scene, and sampling delicious Mexican and Indian cuisine.
The evenings often concluded with open-air talks, where participants relaxed and enjoyed local beers and [Kofola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofola/) at various pubs and bars,
further strengthening connections and creating memorable experiences.
