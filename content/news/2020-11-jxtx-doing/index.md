The [JXTX Foundation's](/jxtx/foundation/) first activity was to [sponsor 10 graduate students to attend the 2020 Biological Data Science Conference](/news/2020-10-jxtx-awardees/) at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  Awards were competitive and we were delighted with our first round of participants.

**[Georgia Doing](https://twitter.com/DoingMicrobio)**, a scholarship awardee and graduate student in the [Hogan Lab](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/hoganlab/) at the [Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/) has this to say:

Attending the [CSHL Biological Data Science meeting](https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=DATA&year=20) as a [JXTX](/jxtx/foundation/) awardee was more intellectually edifying than even my high expectations. Meeting with field-leaders as mentors was such a valuable experience that provided me with a diversity of guidance and perspectives that is profoundly influencing my research and professional development as I finish up my PhD work in microbiology and plan my transition into postdoctoral research in computational biology. Mentors, presenters and fellow poster-presenters and attendees were all so welcoming and engaging that conversations are continuing weeks after the meeting itself and giving rise to interactions that I suspect will last years and even careers. The critical support and preparation I received from the JXTX committee fostered these lasting relationships. I am so thankful to have received this award that came with not only financial support, but an entire community.
