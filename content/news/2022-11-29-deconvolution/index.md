The still new and shiny single-cell analysis topic now boasts a deconvolution tutorial suite! What does deconvolution do you ask? Well, in this context, it infers cell proportions from bulk RNA-seq data. You heard that correctly - instead of expensive new single-cell experiments, you can re-analyse old bulk RNA-seq data and estimate cell proportions. All you need is a reasonably good single cell dataset to use as a reference and youâ€™re good to go! The tutorial suite shows you how to build your reference from publicly available single cell data, and apply analysis to some publicly available bulk RNA-seq data.
