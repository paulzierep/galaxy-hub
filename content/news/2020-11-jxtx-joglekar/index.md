The [JXTX Foundation](/jxtx/foundation/)'s first activity was to [sponsor 10 graduate students to attend the 2020 Biological Data Science Conference](/news/2020-10-jxtx-awardees/) at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  Awards were competitive and we were delighted with our first round of participants.

In graduate school, deadlines are fuzzy and milestones subjective. The JXTX scholarship program provided us with an opportunity to weigh our research progress and contextualize it within a group of fellow graduate students. The organizing team really cared about making our experience at a fully virtual conference as interactive as possible and facilitated dialogue between the awardees. They also connected us to some incredible scientists who, in addition to being experts in their respective fields, are passionate about mentoring students and eager to see us succeed. I benefited immensely from being a JXTX awardee and I cannot wait to celebrate the science being produced by my peers and future awardees!
