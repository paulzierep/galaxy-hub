Many analyses in Galaxy require small data manipulations in between tools as a sort of “glue” between analysis steps. For example, you may need to change the file format, re-order columns in a table, replace certain values, or perform some filtering operation, before you can proceed to the next step of your analysis. Galaxy offers a wide range of tools that can perform such generic data manipulation tasks, and mastering these types of operations in Galaxy can help you streamline your analysis and get the most out of Galaxy.
