Plant lovers are in luck! A new tutorial on this fascinating kingdom has been added to the GTN. It details the necessary steps to identify potential targets of brassinosteroid-induced miRNAs. Brassinosteroids are phytohormones that have the ability to stimulate plant growth and confer resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses. These characteristics have led to great interest in the field of biotechnology due to its potential for increasing agricultural productivity.
