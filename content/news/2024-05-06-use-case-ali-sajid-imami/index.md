__exact topic pending__ (adapt title!)

With this article we would like to share Ali's experience with usegalaxy.eu and its use for his research.

>The world of bioinformatics moves very quickly, and it can often become a race against time to keep up with it. This is not helped by the fragmented nature of the different tool specifications, and it becomes almost impossible to have all the tools available to ensure that you have everything available to run them. Galaxy has made it easier for bioinformaticists to evaluate different tools quickly. Our lab is at the forefront of translational research and precision medicine. Recently, we had to identify potential mutations and other single nucleotide variants present in a patient's genome to determine their genotype concerning a particular gene mutation. Galaxy made it easier to create a fan-in and fan-out technique that lets us run the same dataset through multiple variant discovery pipelines with various parameters. We are incredibly thankful to the Galaxy Governance team for allotting us an expanded quota that allowed us to experiment with the multiple parameter sets and keep the intermediate results safe for provenance reasons.
