Prometheus is an increasingly popular monitoring solution whereby sites expose a /metrics endpoint, and then a central Prometheus server can scrape it for data which is then plotted or visualised or alerted upon. We at the GTN are now testing out a prometheus endpoint for our completely static site which weâ€™ll use to expose some maybe useful statistics about the GTN that others can then scrape and display in ways that are useful for them.
