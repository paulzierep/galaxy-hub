# COVID considerations

A welcoming and inclusive GCC2023 will require respect throughout the community
for a range of comfort levels around how we socially gather. Delegate safety is
a priority and everyone has a role to play in ensuring that everyone can
participate with confidence. 

The WHO declared [novel coronavirus (COVID-19) worldwide
pandemic](https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020)
is still active. We are taking precautions to protect each other from harm and
we expect all delegates to support each other's choices around their own safety.

Australia has one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the world, with
more than 95 per cent of its eligible community fully vaccinated and there are
low case numbers: [Australian Government
stats](https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19/case-numbers-and-statistics?language=und).

Please make yourself aware of our conference venue's [COVIDSafe
guidelines](https://www.thecube.qut.edu.au/visit/covidsafe-guidelines). Check in
with [current local
advice](https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/health-advice/traffic-light-advice)
on keeping safe provided by the Queensland government.

While mask wearing requirements have been removed, GCC2023 delegates are
encouraged to wear a face mask when physical distancing is not possible. In line
with WHO
[recommendations](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks#:~:text=To%20help%20reduce%20the%20spread,are%20unable%20to%20maintain%20distance),
we encourage you to wear a mask when in a crowded, enclosed or poorly
ventilation area. Disposable face masks will be made available at the venue.

Personal health etiquette and hygiene practices remain essential and everyone's
responsibility. Hand sanitiser will be available at key points around our venue. 

If you experience any cold or flu symptoms, please do not attend GCC2023. We
request that you bring RATs with you, and ask you to take a test when you arrive
and before you go home. The organising committee can provide COVID-19 tests as
needed and support you to access further medical assistance.

Rest assured that if you are sick or impacted by COVID-19 and cannot attend we
will refund your registration price and offer the option to attend virtually.
