# GCC2023 Abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of Galaxy Community
Conferences.  These include long talks, short talks, poster presentations, and
demo presentations.  All of these are submitted by the community and go through
a peer review process before being accepted for the program.

Abstract submission deadlines have passed; you can still submit an idea for a
[BoF](#birds-of-a-feather-bof-sessions).

By submitting an abstract for a short of long talk, you agree that at least one
of the authors will register and present the work in-person at GCC2023. Posters
or demos can be presented virtually and at least one of the authors must
register and be available on Zoom/Slack during their scheduled session.

## Poster details

Posters at GCC2023 will be presented in a digital format, on large, TV-sized
monitors (image below). To accommodate this format, **you must use [this
Powerpoint presentation
template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VtwTMaEB-GnRb-XR6MQjpLCcdg7Uzz5f/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100125360277624035474&rtpof=true&sd=true)**
to create your poster. Make a copy of the Powerpoint file and build your poster.
Once you created the poster, use the poster title as the file name and upload a
PNG or JPG version of the file to this [Google Drive
folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G7oFQyjtcZ6yLK7wt8Njg7sBa777d1BO?usp=sharing)
(you will need to sign in using a Google ID).

Complete details about creating a poster from the venue IT are available in
[this
PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hrPtuuvvhkbEt1eoFIlh9JKAS8ncDDSH/view?usp=sharing).
If you have multiple slides, please export those as separate PNG files and save
them to a folder.

Because the venue IT department will roll out the posters to the monitors, **you
will need to upload your poster to the [Google Drive
folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G7oFQyjtcZ6yLK7wt8Njg7sBa777d1BO?usp=sharing)
by June 26, 2023**.

There is [#poster-chat channel](https://gcc2023.slack.com/archives/C058E0U8UC9)
on [GCC2023 conference
Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gcc2023/shared_invite/zt-1ptuyxw02-QHSHuHdyogdhSY~dxqnTXg).
This channel will be used by virtual attendees and allow asynchronous
communication about the posters so please join this Slack channel and upload
your poster.

## Talk details

Slides for your talk will be projected on a screen in the 16:10 format.

Long talks will be 15 minutes total (including any questions and answers from
the audience). Short talks will be 7 minutes total.

Because GCC2023 is a hybrid event with virtual participants, the organizers will
need to ensure all the slides for talks are uniformly available for remote
attendees. Hence, **we ask that you create your slides in [Google
Slides](https://slides.google.com)** and share the slide deck with *anyone with the
link* (in view-only mode). Then, **share that link with Enis Afgan via email by
July 1, 2023**.


# Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions

Birds of a Feather, or BoF, sessions are informal gatherings during GCC that
allow participants to discus topics of interest. These are free-form events
that are organized by the participants and can take any form you'd like (eg,
presentations, brainstorming, architecture drawing, etc.).

**Interested in organizing a BoF? [Fill out this
form](https://forms.gle/UU6o9bT329kP9HS7A)** with some details so we can add it
to the schedule and help advertise. Also, peep an open mind and feel free to
propose fun activities as well, such as an evening run or a city tour.


## Abstract guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then
presentations) that will resonate with GCC2023 participants.

* **Limited to 500 words.** Please be concise and to the point. Abstract
  submission is a web form so no graphics or references are to be included.
* **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does your work use, describe, extend, deploy,
  benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem? If it does not, then it
  may not reviewed.
* **Compelling.** Is the work compelling? Will GCC2023 participants find your
  presentation interesting? Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting
  results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on.
* **Open Source / Open Access.** Not all presented work / resources must be open
  source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason why
  it isn't. For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company, behind a
  firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you learned, and
  any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem. An abstract that
  merely highlights an inaccessible resource is not compelling.
* **Project Update.** If an abstract is a project update for a project that has
  previously been presented at a GCC, then it needs to describe a significant
  update to be considered for a talk. Minor updates submitted as talks will be
  offered a poster or demo spot.


# Option to publish in F1000 Galaxy gateway

Following GCC2023, you'll have an option to publish your slides or poster in the
[F1000 Galaxy gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy/). Besides
being a great collection of Galaxy-related content, each published artifact gets
a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), making it easier to reference in the future.


# Questions?

Got questions about abstracts, abstract submission, or BoFs? Ask the [Scientific Program
Committee](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2023/organizers/#scientific-program-committee).
