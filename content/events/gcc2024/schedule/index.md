                    The microGalaxy Special Interest Group (SIG) is a group of researchers and bioinformaticians who collaborate to develop and optimise scientific analytical for microbial data using the Galaxy platform. This SIG aims to (i) develop, maintain, and sustain microbial data analysis in Galaxy, (ii) establish and implement standardised "best practices", (iii) expand documentation and training resources, (iv) coordinate collaborative efforts to avoid redundancy and prioritise tools, workflows, and training (v) outreach to the microbiology research communities both within and outside the Galaxy. In this BoF, we will talk about the recent efforts of the community (tools, workflows, training, resource catalog, papers) and plan efforts for the next months.<br/>
                    We will also discuss the GDSCN and BioDIGS projects, which are looking to get interested researchers and students involved in soil metagenomics.

                    In the era of big data, the ability to manage and process vast, often distributed datasets efficiently is crucial for scientific research and data-driven decision-making. In this Birds of a Feather (BoF) session we want to discuss the challenges and strategies associated with handling large amounts of data stored externally -  on tape, an HPC filesystem, experimental facility, cloud platforms, etc., within the Galaxy platform. A crucial aspect of this session will be the collection of requirements and experiences from diverse scientific domains, including photon, neutron, muon science, astronomy, and others. We will also exchange experiences from various institutions, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) who developed the Rucio object store plugin for data management. By understanding the unique needs and challenges of these fields, we aim to gather valuable insights to discuss with Galaxy developers about what can be done to develop more tailored and effective solutions for data management in Galaxy. We would also like to discuss Galaxy deferred datasets and see to what extent they can help address the issue.

                    The Key Usage Indicators dashboard for Galaxy (available at gxy.io/kui) is new community resource that focuses on exposing usegalaxy service usage data for easy consumption. In this BoF, we will discuss topics such as what data to capture, how to visualize it, how to use it, as well as go over the technical implementation details in search of improvements. Join this BoF if you are interested in using service usage data to craft the future of Galaxy.

                    The network of Galaxy and Pulsar installations is growing steadily. For both operation oversight and dissemination purposes it is desirable to visualize the flow of jobs and data transfers as a map overlay; several isolated attempts to do so have been already done. The BoF goal is to discuss ideas what is the traffic to visualize, how to render it, what data are required to do so, and how these data can be gathered.

With the EuroScienceGateway project we could build up national Galaxy instances and a European wide Pulsar Network, EGI technologies could be integrated and Galaxy's is reaching 100.000 and more users in Europe. In this BoF we would like to discuss the releatonship between EOSC and Galaxy, how to reach more communities and what comes after the EuroScienceGateway proejct.

# Social Programme

## Conference Dinner

The conference dinner will take place in the [Augistinian
Abbey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Thomas%27s_Abbey,_Brno) at Mendel's
square, the place where Gregor Mendel conducted his experiments. The price for a ticket is EUR70 excluding VAT.
During the
dinner, participants have free access to the [Mendel
Museum](https://mendelmuseum.muni.cz/en). Please remember to bring your conference badge to dinner.

Participants may join the guided tours
of the abbey including Mendel's room and the library shortly before (staring 18:30 & 19:15) or after the dinner (starting 21:00).

unique perspective. Explore the main sights of the city centre in our [guided
tours](https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/explore-brno/) organized by the Brno Tourist
Information Centre, including the Old Town Hall, St Peter's Cathedral as well as
the Freedom and Market Square.


### Villa Tugendhat

Those interested in architecture will have the unique opportunity to visit the
